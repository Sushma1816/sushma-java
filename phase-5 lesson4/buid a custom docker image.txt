Step 4.1.1: Clone Git repository
●	First, clone the Git repository on a Docker host using the command below:
		git clone https://github.com/Anuj1990/Docker.git
Step 4.1.2: Docker Build
●	Then, proceed with the docker build command to build a custom docker image.
cd Docker
		dockerbuild -t phpcode . -f Dockerfile

●	Once the image is built, check the image using docker run command and then run it to initialize custom container on Docker host.
docker images
docker run -d --name phpcode -p 80:80 phpcode


●	Once the container is up and running, validate the connectivity using the curl command to see if php code is running on port 80 or not.


Step 4.1.3: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●	Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
●	Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
